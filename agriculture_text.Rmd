A variety of bird species, typically grassland and shrubland species, are declining as a result of the loss of small-scale farming operations, and thus, an increase in high-impact agriculture (Murphy, 2003). Studies have found that bird speciesâ€™ productivity, population size, and community structure are impacted by shifting agricultural practices, such as earlier and more frequent mowing (Murphy 2003), which result in a decrease in quality nesting habitat for birds. 


Previous studies have found that expanding agricultural practices led to the decline of red-winged blackbirds and other grassland species, as breeding habitats are impacted (Blackwell and Dolbeer 2001; Murphy 2003).
