## Exploring the Effects of Landcover Type on Red-Winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus)  
##### By Mickayla Johnston

Welcome to my Shiny app on exploring the effects of landcover type on red-winged blackbird occurrence. 

On the navigation panel at the top, you will find tabs to explore interactive maps of red-winged blackbird occurrence across their North America range, explore interactive plots, view the original data, and learn more about the project. 

This Shiny App was created as a final project for an R course at University of Massachuesetts Boston, and uses data gathered from my Master's thesis first chapter. Check out the 'About' tab to learn more.
