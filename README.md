# bio355-proj
Final Project for BIO355 Spring 2020

This code was used for a final project in BIO 355- an r stats course at Umass Boston- in Spring 2020. 
The goal of the project was to create a shiny app that allowed users to interactively explore eBird data using maps, plots, and statistics.
The data used for this project, which was collected from eBird and ArcMap, included presence/absence data on red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), and land cover data percentages associated with each presence/absence point.

See the app (https://mickaylaj.shinyapps.io/final/) to learn more about the project and data.
